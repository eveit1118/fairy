    I don’t fully know what I want to do for the final project, but I am leaning towards the data visualization option. It is something different then I did last time so I might learn different skills, but it also might be harder. I don’t think I can think of another creative game especially not with infinite levels without it being very boring so that's why I want to do the visual data representation instead. I think what I would do is album sales of kpop group Zerobaseone. This is also lowkey a favor for a friend because I told him I would compile their sales overtime so he could use it for a personal project. They have a total of four albums that I would want to track, Youth in the Shade, Melting Point, You Had Me at Hello, and Cinema Paradise. Each of those albums have 2-3 different album packings so I could track what one sold more. Some of the album packaging is much prettier than others and I wonder if sales reflect that. They also sell member specific versions so I would see if I could track what member sold the most of their solo albums. I honestly do not know what you mean by taking data from over 1000 sources but I think we could figure something out for that. I know for a fact all four albums have sold over one million copies each. I think I would represent the sales as bar graphs as basic as that is. I would have a way to click for each album and compare them against each other maybe. You would be able to compare each album and version against a different album version.
